# Data Structure Set 3

1. find lowest common ancestor between two nodes from the given binary tree.
```
           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \   / \
      4   5 6   7
     /
    8

node[2,3] = 1
node[4,5] = 2
node[6,7] = 3
```
2. Find next node in same level for given node in a binary tree
```
           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \     \
      4   5     6
               / \
              7   8

Next node of 2 is 3
Next node of 5 is 6
Next node of 7 is 8
Next node of 8 is null
